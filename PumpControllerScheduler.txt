Pressure Controller Frequency 100hz
read the sensor
convert the sensor bit to PSI
ensure gPressurePSI is not less than zero for jitter
read the user input (disired duty or desired pressure)
transform ADC 0-1023 to 0-100 duty cycle int
check the max pressure isn't exceeded
change the desired duty cycle with kP loop
linearize the snow stageII controll with EEPROM lookup table
write the PWM output register

Fastest readout frequency (lcd, serial, SD) 10hz
read the system voltage
convert to float
convert the output PWM to average analog voltage (float)
calculate the pump controller (pump motor) duty cycle
get the DateTime from the RTC
print stuff to the sd card buffer and serial terminal if echo serial is 1


LCD frequency 5hz
move the cursors and print display variables
(labels are from setup)
flush SD card related ram locations to card
